# Attention-based-End-to-End-Speech-to-Text-Deep-Neural-Network

Implements attention based speech to text transcription using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Dense Networks. End-to-end the system transcribes a given speech utterance to its corresponding transcript.
This project implements the paper [Listen, Attend and Spell](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.01211.pdf) with LAS Variant 1.
